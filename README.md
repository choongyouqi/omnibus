## About the Repository

_Omnibus_ is a repository covering all my experiences in software development.

This repository contains the source code for the hundreds of sample apps, scripts and snippet codes. These 
samples are updated as my understanding is, with `git` tags applied to tie sample code versions.

The samples, were written by Choong You Qi. You may also have run into him through
Stack Overflow:

## About the Code

All of the source code in this archive is licensed under the
Apache 2.0 license except as noted.

The names of the top-level directories roughly correspond to a
shortened form of the chapter titles. Since chapter numbers
change with every release, and since some samples are used by
multiple chapters, I am loathe to put chapter numbers in the
actual directory names.
